# Requirements: the employees data from Exercise 17.

# Load the employees data and convert it into a tibble. Then, make the gender and title variables into a factor.

# Hint: the commands are analogous to the as.data.frame() function.

# Check if the data has any missing values.

# Arrange the dataset by gender, then last name, and make first_name, last_name, and gender the first three variables in the data frame. Show only the employees whose salary is higher than 70,000.

# Use the ends_with() function with select.

# Create a data frame containing only the employee numbers of those earning more than 70,000.

# Find out how much each position (title) earns on average by gender; create a new variable that represents the average monthly figures and arrange your result by gender and average monthly salary, from largest to smallest.
