# Create a vector called cards that stores the following elements:
  
#Blue-Eyes White Dragon
#Exodius
#The Winged Dragon of Ra
#Raigeki
#Slifer the Sky Dragon
#Obelisk the Tormentor
#Black Luster Soldier
#5-Headed Dragon
#Exodia the Forbidden One
#Dragon Master Knight

# Check the type of cards.

# Create a vector called atk and assign to it the following values:
  
  
#3000
#NA
#NA
#NA
#NA
#4000
#3000
#5000
#1000
#5000

# Check the type of atk.

# Use the combine function to combine cards and atk into a single vector called yugioh.

# Check the type of the new object.

# What conclusions can you draw from this? 
# If we had added TRUE/FALSE values to the atk vector, what would have the print(atk) command returned? 
# What about print(yugioh)?
