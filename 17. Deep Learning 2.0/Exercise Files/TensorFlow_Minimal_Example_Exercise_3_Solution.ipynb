    "    3. Change the loss function. An alternative loss for regressions is the Huber loss. \n",
    "    The Huber loss is more appropriate than the L2-norm when we have outliers, as it is less sensitive to them (in our example we don't have outliers, but you will surely stumble upon a dataset with outliers in the future). The L2-norm loss puts all differences *to the square*, so outliers have a lot of influence on the outcome. \n",
    "    The proper syntax of the Huber loss is 'huber_loss'\n",

    "Some takeaways:\n",
    "1. Any function that has the property to be lower for better results and higher for worse results can be a loss function.\n",
    "This includes the Huber loss.\n",
    "2. Almost everything seems identical.\n",
    "3. The values of the loss are generally lower (because of the Huber loss formula, and the convexity of the two functions).\n",
    "4. For our problem, both the mean squared loss and the Huber loss work equally well. \n",
    "5. Generally, the Huber loss is used when we have a lot of outliers."
