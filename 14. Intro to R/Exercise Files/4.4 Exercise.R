# Requirements: the following vectors: the original cards object, and atk from the second exercise.

# Assign a name to each element from the atk vector that corresponds to a character from the cards vector.

# Check the attributes of the atk element.

# Is there another command you can use to check if the atk object has names assigned to it?
  
# Remove the names.

# Can you think of another way to assign names to the atk object?
