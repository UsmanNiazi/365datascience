# Create a 5x5 matrix with the rnorm() function, and a 5x5 matrix with runif(). Create each in a single line of code (Hint: nest the operations)

# For the two matrices, get the following information; for the first four, save the new values as columns in their corresponding matrixes:
  
#Column averages
#Row averages
#Column sums
#Row sums
#Minimum and maximum value in the matrix
#Minimum and maximum value for the 3rd column in each matrix
#The means and standard deviations for each matrix (compare the two values; if interested in the mathematics side of things, recreate the matrices a couple of times, and compare the results; can you explain what is happening?)
