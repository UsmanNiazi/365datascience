    "First, we have to define a custom optimizer (as we did in the TensorFlow intro).\n",
    "\n",
    "We create the custom optimizer with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    custom_optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we change the respective argument in model.compile to reflect this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    model.compile(optimizer=custom_optimizer, loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the learning rate is lower than normal, we may need to adjust the max_epochs (to, say, 50). \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is basically the same, but we reach it much slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Adam adapts to the problem, if the orders of magnitude are too different, it may not have enough time to adjust accordingly."

    "\n",
    "The dataset is called MNIST and refers to handwritten digit recognition. You can find more about it on Yann LeCun's website (Director of AI Research, Facebook). He is one of the pioneers of what we've been talking about and of more complex approaches that are widely used today, such as covolutional neural networks (CNNs). \n",

    "The dataset provides 70,000 images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (1 digit per image). \n",
