We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 150 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at three locations - Hamburg, Berlin, and Portland.</p>\\n<h2><strong>HOW THE ROLE WORKS</strong></h2>\\n<p>We are building services that provide a fully fledged feature set of urban mobility service providers. Our backend enables the moovel mobility app to find nearby mobility options like car or bike-sharing as well as scooters and ride-hailing services. It also allows booking functionality and handles payment.\\nOur services interact with moovel’s mobility platform as well as external APIs.

You'll develop internal tools and systems for all engineering teams to use. Using site reliability principles and a robust approach to observability, you will not only fix problems but solve the issues that contributed to them when things go wrong.</p>\\n<p>This position works closely with Release Engineering and other engineering teams in our System's Zone to develop and maintain the tools and systems that support all of Zapier engineering. This role calls upon a broad range of experience and technologies. You'll get to interact with every engineering team in the organization. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with those teams regularly is key to success.</p>\\n<p>Zapier is rapidly scaling and growing, and you will work directly on the applications that support over 5 million customers. When bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, to learn from failures, and to build a robust and resilient system for our customers.\\xa0</p>\\n<p>Building new features and services is a big part of this role.

Well-honed experience with the fundamentals of software development goes a long way here. Python and Go, we do it all. Generalists thrive in this role.</p>\\n<p>Writing is our primary means of communication, from pull requests, team chat, knowledge sharing, and communicating changes. Excellent writing skills are crucial to success here at Zapier. We are 100% remote and commonly work asynchronously. We even wrote a book on it.</p>\\n<p>You should feel comfortable taking a default to action. Most decisions are changeable. It's better to deliver something real today over something maybe better later. Sharing context, goals, objectives, and in-progress work in public helps us all achieve a common goal.</p>\\n<p><strong>Things You’ll Do</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Develop new methods for retaining task history</li>\\n<li>Migrating applications and services from EC2 to Kubernetes</li>\\n<li>Write custom Kubernetes controllers to improve resilience</li>\\n<li>Create deployment pipelines in ArgoCD</li>\\n<li>Develop autoscaling strategies to handle bursts in workloads</li>\\n<li>Implementing OPA to enforce policies across our Kubernetes Clusters</li>\\n<li>Deploying ProxySQL for pooling connections against MySQL databases</li>\\n<li>Have an enormous impact working closely with teams across the organization.

To jump-start the process we ask a few questions we normally would ask at the start of an interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate. Please make sure to answer each question.</p>\\n<p>After you apply, you are going to hear back from us, even if we don't seem like a good fit.

Are you ready to put your skills to the test? As a Credit Risk Modeler will you build or validate risk models that have a direct impact on bank business and the lives of millions of customers. We’ve got a challenge you can really sink your teeth into.</p>\\n<h2>Making a difference</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Depending on your experience and skills, you will build, test, develop and/or validate comprehensive risk models that support the bank’s ambitions and safeguard our customers</li>\\n<li>Think here of mathematical, data-driven credit risk models</li>\\n<li>You will work closely with colleagues and stakeholders of all nationalities to solve highly complex challenges and establish workable models that the bank can put into practice</li>\\n<li>You’ll work intensely with a variety of stakeholders, including Risk Management, Finance and external regulators (like DNB and ECB), IT and more</li>\\n<li>So in addition to putting your modelling skills to the test, we’ll also ask you to contribute to the team dynamic in a positive way</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Your technology stack consists of Python, Matlab, SQL and GIT, or comparable packages and programming languages.</p>\\n<h2>With each other</h2>\\n<p>Collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We bring teams of talented people together to develop the next generation of risk models that not only thrill our regulators, but also drive our business forward. Both Risk Modelling (ALM &amp; Credit) and Model Validation operate in an open atmosphere of collaboration and service. We know that no one can solve the complex challenges of risk modelling on her/his own. It takes a well-rounded team of experienced professionals who are willing to look beyond their own accomplishments and work together to achieve a common objective. Whether it’s safeguarding Rabobank’s €200 billion mortgage portfolio, or calculating the risk-reward ratio of a large multi-national wholesale client, you will play a key role in processes that affect nearly every aspect of the bank’s business.\\nWith you as a Risk Modeler, you will strike a balance between strong leadership and open collaboration, with team members like:</p>\\n<p>Maikel, Team Lead IFRS9: “No one can solve the complex issues of modelling alone. That’s why the team works closely together to contribute to the overall result. You won’t ever hear ‘that’s not my job’. Much more often, you’ll hear, ‘how can I help?’ The person who leads this team should not be afraid to get her/his hands dirty. Every member of the team contributes. There are no ivory towers.”</p>\\n<h2>With you</h2>\\n<p>If we were to ask your friends to describe you in a few key words, the answer would be: customer-focused, confident, and able to take on challenges with confidence and flexibility.\\nWe’re searching for Credit Risk Modelers of all levels, but particularly mid- and senior-level analysts. Got what it takes to join our team? Then you will likely have:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A master\\'s degree in a quantitative field (econometrics, mathematics, physics, AI or similar)</li>\\n<li>A passion for using/developing models to solve complex problems</li>\\n<li>Familiarity with Python would be of great value</li>\\n<li>Experience with programming is a plus: if you speak Matlab, SQL or GIT, you’ve got a head start. If you don’t, we’ll teach you</li>\\n<li>Minimum of 3 years experience in – and affinity for – working with data</li>\\n<li>It’s important to note that we aren’t just looking for top Risk Modelers who are great at modelling. You’ll also need to be a true team player, with excellent communication skills in English, the ability to take other (non-analyst’s) interests into consideration. Timing is always a factor in what we do, so you will need to be able to perform well under pressure, and manage your time effectively. Flexibility and adaptability are definitely expected</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Growing a better world together</h2>\\n<p>Rabobank is a financial services provider for 7.1 million customers in 40 countries. But did you know that we are also working to make the world a better place? We do so in countless ways, such as:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Actively protecting our clients by ensuring that the funds we lend and the mortgages we provide are well within acceptable risk levels;</li>\\n<li>Working toward a new generation of risk models that not only fulfil regulatory requirements, but also allow us to expand our reach and help more people, communities and societies to thrive.Safeguarding our investments in nature, culture, agriculture and development with risk models that sustain and advance the bank’s position.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Interested?</h2>\\n<p>Do you want to become the ideal version of yourself? We would love to help you achieve this by focusing firmly on your growth, development, and investing in an environment where you keep learning every day. We give you the space to innovate and initiate. In this way, we offer you numerous opportunities to grow and help you exceed your expectations, to do the right thing exceptionally well, and to therefore grow as a professional. In addition, with us (on the basis of a 40 hour working week), you can expect:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>A gross annual salary between €53k and €110k, depending on your experience and Seniority.</li>\\n<li>A thirteenth month and holiday pay;</li>\\n<li>An Employee Benefit Budget of your gross monthly salary. You decide how to spend this budget. This may include purchasing extra leave days, or making extra pension contributions;</li>\\n<li>Flexible working times and location-independent working;</li>\\n<li>100% reimbursement of commuting costs if you travel by public transport. Do you still prefer to travel by car or motorbike? Then choose a home/work travel allowance;</li>\\n<li>A pension scheme, to which your contribution is only 5%.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Let\\'s meet</h2>\\n<p>Are you the person we\\'re looking for?

In this project, we are connecting a lot of different data sources, analyze data using statistical models and provide a simple user interface for our pricing team so they can run simulations on their own.</p>\\n<p>Your first task could include an extension of this product. You would work hand-in-hand with our data analysts in order to improve statistical models that were developed by them, add more data sources, improve the user interface and the overall - still PoC-ish - architecture.</p>\\n<p><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></p>\\n<p><strong>Python</strong> powers most of our microservices which are deployed to <strong>Kubernetes</strong>. We prefer quality over high output: All code is committed to <strong>Git</strong>. We use <strong>GitLab CI</strong> and manage our infrastructure in <strong>Terraform</strong>. Our services are running on <strong>AWS</strong> exclusively.</p>\\n<p>Data processing and business logic happen in <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Spark</strong>, workflow orchestration are done by <strong>Airflow</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Interested?
