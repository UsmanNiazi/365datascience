# Create a data frame that looks like this:

#Months old        Size Weight Breed
#Flipper         53      medium     21   dog
#Bromley         19       small      8   dog
#Nox             34      medium      4   cat
#Orion           41       large      6   cat
#Dagger          84       small      7   dog
#Zizi           140 extra small      2   cat
#Carrie         109       large     36   dog

# Can you think of a way to invert the values for breed?
  
# Hint: if you haven't set the stringsAsFactors argument to FALSE, all your character variables will be recorded as factors. Edit the levels of the Breed variable to complete the task.

# You can access a specific variable in a data frame like you would in a matrix.
